# Learn AngularJS
This is the repository for Ray Villalobos course, [Learn AngularJS](http://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Up-Running-AngularJS/154414-2.html). 

## Course Description
Get a fresh look at AngularJS, a "superheroic" framework for building single-page web applications fast. Ray Villalobos shows you how to understand the practical uses of AngularJS with a directory search projectâ€”a traditional type of web app you can add to your existing sites. He defines the MVC architecture underlying AngularJS: the model (your data), views (how data is flowed into your template), and controllers (the JavaScript that links the two together). You then learn how to divide your project into modules; work with services like $http, $routeProvider and set up deep linking. Start now, and learn the simple way to build your own complex web application.

## Topics include:
- What is AngularJS?
- Working with complex models
- Using a the $http service to read a JSON file
- Binding data
- Dividing your app into partials
- Creating a details template
- Using AngularJS animation events
